Suppose you're a teacher's assistant at a university. You're tasked with developing an application that helps calculate students' grade point average. The application uses the students' grades and credit hours taken to calculate their overall GPA. You're also provided a required format for reporting the students' GPA.<br>
This module will guide you through the steps required to develop your GPA Calculator application. Your code will declare and assign values to variables based on course information, perform various numeric calculations, and format and display the results. Calculations include determining the sum of the grade points earned and total credit hours.
